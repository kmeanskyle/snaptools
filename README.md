Some R code for working with datasets produced by the Scenarios Network for Alaska + Arctic Planning. 

Current version is limited to extracting output produced by dynamical downscaling efforts with the WRF model on a 20-km grid encompassing Alaska and the surrounding regions. Infomormation about these data can be found [here.](http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset/historical-and-projected-dynamically-downscaled-climate-data-for-the-state-of-alaska-and-surrou)
